# App Introduction

## Basic Requirements

A web application called “Food delivery application” is required to connect restaurants and potential consumers.
This application is intended to create a bridge between restaurants and consumers. 
Restaurants’ owners can sign up and list their food items along with descriptions, photos and prices. 
Customers also can sign up, view the restaurants nearby, their food items, and order food from any selected restaurants.
Restaurants should accept the order and assign a delivery person to the order. The order number, status of the order, location of the delivery person and the estimated time of delivery (ETD) must be displayed to the user who ordered food. The payment system is not included in this prototype application.
When the food is delivered, the status of the order should be updated accordingly. 
The system maintains a list of past orders for each user. When a restaurant updates its menu/pricelists or has a new offer, it can send notifications to users that they have made purchases from them in the past.
Other requirements include:
• When a restaurant signs up to the system, an admin person should verify and approve their request.
• The admin can reject or approve a request from a new restaurant, and only when a restaurant is
approved, then it can advertise its food items to customers.

## Additional Requirements

These requirements are optional, and you can claim extra credits, but your mark cannot go beyond 100% of the coursework mark. They are only intended for students who are already familiar with the basics of web development and they want to extend their experience with the platform and also claim extra credits. Please decide wisely, and you should not scarify other modules time to achieve these requirements.
1. User signup/login using social media accounts such as Google and Facebook.
2. Sending a verification email to user that sign up to verify their identity
